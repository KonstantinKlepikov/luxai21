    "- Mining resources near your opponent's citytiles so they have less easy access to resources\n",
    "- Using carts to deliver resources from far away clusters of wood, coal, uranium to a city in need\n",
    "- Sending worker units over to the opponent's roads and pillaging them to slow down their agent\n",
    "- Optimizing over how much to mine out of forests before letting them regrow so you can build more cities and get sustainable fuel"
