    "- pillage(): str - returns the pillage action. When applied, Unit will pillage the tile it is currently on top of and remove 0.5 of the road level."

    "- Using the build city action to build new cities and thus build new units\n",
    "- Having cities perform research each turn to unlock new resources\n",
    "- Writing collision-free code that lets units move smoothly around and through each other when navigating to targets\n",
    "- Mining resources near your opponent's citytiles so they have less easy access to resources\n",
    "- Using carts to deliver resources from far away clusters of wood, coal, uranium to a city in need\n",
    "- Sending worker units over to the opponent's roads and pillaging them to slow down their agent\n",
    "- Optimizing over how much to mine out of forests before letting them regrow so you can build more cities and get sustainable fuel"
